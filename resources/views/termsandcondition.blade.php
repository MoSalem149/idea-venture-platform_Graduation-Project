                  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-tu3la5">Investing in private company securities
                    is not suitable for all investors. An investment in private company securities is highly speculative
                    and involves a high degree of risk. It should only be considered a long-term investment. You must be
                    prepared to withstand a total loss of your investment. Private company securities are also highly
                    illiquid, and there is no guarantee that a market will develop for such securities. Each investment
                    also carries its own specific risks, and you should complete your own independent due diligence
                    regarding the investment. This includes obtaining additional information about the company,
                    opinions, financial projections, and legal or other investment advice. Accordingly, investing in
                    private company securities is appropriate only for those investors who can tolerate a high degree of
                    risk and do not require a liquid investment. See additional general disclosures <a

                    (“SE Marketplace”) is a website operated by IdeaVenture Primary, LLC (“SE Primary”), a broker-dealer
                    that is registered with the SEC and a member of FINRA and the SIPC.</p>
                  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-tu3la5">IdeaVenture Secondary (“SE Secondary”) is
                    our investor trading platform. SE Secondary is an SEC-registered Alternative Trading System (“ATS”)
                    operated by SE Primary that matches orders for buyers and sellers of securities. It allows investors
                    to trade shares purchased through Regulation A+, Regulation Crowdfunding, or Regulation D for
                    companies who have engaged IdeaVenture Secure LLC as their transfer agent. The term “Rapid,” when
                    used in relation to transactions on SE Marketplace, specifically refers to transactions that are
                    facilitated on SE Secondary, This is because, unlike with trades on the IdeaVenture Bulletin Board
                    (“SE BB”), trades on SE Secondary are executed the moment that they are matched.</p>
                  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-tu3la5">IdeaVenture Bulletin Board is a bulletin
                    board platform on which users can indicate to each other their interest to buy or sell shares of
                    private companies that previously executed Reg CF or Reg A offerings not necessarily through SE
                    Primary. <br>
                    <hr> As a bulletin board platform, SE BB provides a venue for investors to access information about
                    such private company offerings and connect with potential sellers. All investment opportunities on
                    SE BB are based on indicated interest from sellers and will need to be confirmed. Even if parties
                    express mutual interest to enter into a trade on SE BB, a trade will not immediately result because
                    execution is subject to additional contingencies, including among others, effecting of the transfer
                    of the shares from the potential seller to the potential buyer by the issuer and/or transfer agent.
                    SE BB is distinct and separate from SE Secondary.
                    <hr>
                  <p> SE Secondary facilitates the trading of securities by matching orders between buyers and sellers
                    and facilitating executions of trades on the platform. By contrast, under SE BB, SE Primary assists
                    with the facilitation of a potential resulting trade off platform including, by among other things,
                    approaching the issuer and other necessary parties in relation to the potential transaction. The
                    term “Extended”, when used in relation to transactions on SE Marketplace denotes that these
                    transactions are conducted via SE BB, and that these transactions may involve longer processing
                    times compared to SE Secondary for the above-stated reasons.</p>

                    displayed on SE Marketplace, there is no guarantee an active trading market for the securities will
